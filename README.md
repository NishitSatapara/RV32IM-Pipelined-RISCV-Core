# RV32IM 5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Processor

## Overview

This project implements a 32-bit RV32IM 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor using Verilog HDL. The processor is designed to execute instructions through the standard pipeline stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB).

The design focuses on understanding processor architecture, pipelining, hazard handling, datapath design, and control-path implementation. A modular approach has been used to improve readability, scalability, and verification.

## Major Modules

### Fetch Cycle

Responsible for program counter management and instruction fetching from instruction memory.

### Decode Cycle

Decodes instructions, reads register operands, generates immediate values, and creates control signals.

### Execute Cycle

Performs arithmetic, logical, comparison, address calculation, and branch evaluation operations.

### Memory Cycle

Handles load and store instructions through data memory access.

### Writeback Cycle

Writes the final execution result back to the register file.

### Hazard Unit

Detects instruction dependencies and generates forwarding/control signals to maintain correct pipeline execution.

---

## Hazard Handling

### Data Hazards

Resolved using forwarding paths from later pipeline stages to the Execute stage.

### Control Hazards

Managed through branch evaluation and program counter redirection.

### Forwarding Logic

Reduces unnecessary pipeline stalls by supplying the most recent operand values directly from later stages.
